# World's worst emulator
I have been untrue to KISS lately and I believe that it's made me lazy. So I 
did the rational thing which I do once every few months and decided to write
an emulator. But I also decided that this time it's going to be in C with
absolutely minimal bloat- No fancy libraries or interesting technologies
or basically anything that isn't ABSOLUTELY necessary included. None of it.
Just pure, awful C.

Why "World's worst"? Because I've decided to write the ISA while implementing
the emulator.
